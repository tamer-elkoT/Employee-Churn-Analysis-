## 📁 Dataset Overview – *Employee Turnover (Churn) Dataset*
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

This dataset provides detailed information about **14,999 employees** and is designed to support **employee churn prediction** – the task of determining whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not.

It is a typical **binary classification problem**, where the target variable (`quit`) indicates whether an employee **has left (1)** or **is still working (0)**. The dataset includes **organizational, behavioral, and performance-related features** that can be used to build predictive models.

### 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to **build machine learning models** that help Human Resources (HR) teams proactively identify employees who are likely to leave, so the organization can take corrective actions.

You will:

* Build and train **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers.
* Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
* Improve model performance through **hyperparameter tuning**, focusing on:

  * `max_depth`
  * `min_samples_split`
  * `min_samples_leaf`

### 📊 Dataset Structure

* **Number of Instances (Rows):** 14,999
* **Number of Features (Columns):** 10 (independent variables) + 1 target variable (`quit`)
* **Missing Values:** None
* **Target Variable:** `quit` (1 = employee left, 0 = employee stayed)

| `average_montly_hours`  | int       | Average number of hours worked per month                                   |
| `time_spend_company`    | int       | Number of years the employee has stayed with the company                   |
| `Work_accident`         | int       | Whether the employee had a work-related accident (1 = Yes, 0 = No)         |
| `promotion_last_5years` | int       | Whether the employee was promoted in the last 5 years (1 = Yes, 0 = No)    |
| `department`            | object    | Department the employee belongs to (e.g., sales, technical, support, etc.) |
| `salary`                | object    | Salary category: `low`, `medium`, or `high`                                |
| `quit`                  | int       | Target variable: 1 = employee left, 0 = employee stayed                    |

### 📈 Insights from the Data

* The majority of employees did **not receive a promotion** in the last 5 years.
* Most employees belong to the **sales department** and have a **low salary**.
* Employee **satisfaction level** appears to be a key factor affecting whether they leave.
* There is a wide range in **average monthly hours**, which may indicate overwork or imbalance in workload distribution.
* Only a small fraction of employees had work accidents or received promotions.

---

### 🔧 Recommended Preprocessing

To prepare the data for modeling, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Encode Categorical Features:**

   * Use One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding for `department` and `salary`.

2. **Normalize or Scale Numerical Features (Optional):**

   * Standardize variables like `average_montly_hours`, `satisfaction_level` if using models sensitive to scale.

3. **Handle Class Imbalance (if needed):**

   * Check the distribution of the `quit` variable. If imbalanced, consider techniques like:

     * Stratified sampling
     * SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

4. **Feature Selection / Correlation Analysis:**

   * Analyze which features contribute most to employee churn using correlation heatmaps or feature importance scores.

### ✅ Why This Dataset Matters

Understanding employee churn is critical for businesses, as high turnover leads to:

* Increased recruitment and training costs
* Loss of experienced personnel
* Lower team morale and productivity
* Disruption in company operations

By analyzing this dataset and developing a reliable prediction model, HR departments can:

* Identify at-risk employees early
* Investigate and resolve churn drivers
* Improve employee satisfaction and retention strategies
* Make data-driven decisions for promotions, compensation, and workload balancing
